          <p>
            In 1989, the World Wide Web as we know it was invented by Tim
            Berners-Lee at CERN (among other collaborators), motivated by the
            ability to cross-reference research papers via the Internet.
          </p>

          <p>
            HTML was invented shortly afterwards by Tim to provide text markup
            capabilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Internet had been around for some time following the ARPANet
            project in the 1960's, but the Web and HTML provided the ability to
            navigate documents published online and communicate with other
            hosts. The Domain Name System (DNS) was a very important innovation
            that supported easy access to websites by mapping easy-to-remember
            URL names to more cumbersome IP addresses.
          </p>

          <p>
            During the development of HTML as a hypertext markup language, Tim
            Berners-Lee also invented HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) for
            retrieving document text via hypertext links.
          </p>

          >
            first web page
          </a>
          was launched on August 6 1991.

          <p>
            One of the first text-based browsers was called Lynx, invented by
            Lou Montulli and released in March 1993. Not long after, the Mosaic
            browser was released in April 1993, supporting visual features in
            HTML like images, nested lists, and forms. Mosaic would be replaced
            by the more popular browser Netscape the following year in November
            by Marc Andreesen, and takes credit for extending the HTML language
            with new tags. These extensions unfortunately included
            presentational HTML tags that could be used to design web pages,
            resulting in web pages losing their semantic meaning.
          </p>

          <p>
            Presentational tags would later be discouraged after the invention
            of CSS by H&aringkon Wium Lie in October 1994 to de-couple document
            structure and style.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1994, the World Wide Consortium (W3C) was formed to establish a
            set of open standards for the web, and still lives on to this day.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have seen an exciting number of developments over the last three
            decades in web publishing, including the addition of CSS and
            JavaScript to provide page styling and interactivity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every webpage you visit likely has at least three languages working
            together to provide content structure, style, and interactivity. In
            1995, Brendan Elrich invented JavaScript (in 11 days!) as a language
            to interact with page elements and listen to different events on the
            page. As with HTML and CSS, JavaScript has presented a number of
            standardization issues across browsers, notably Internet Explorer 6.
            But standards have improved significantly since HTML5, CSS3, and ES6
            JavaScript.

          <h2>HTML5</h2>

          <p>
            In 2014, HTML5 was released by W3C with various important new
            features, notably special elements for semantic tags. Semantic tags
            have made for more standardized content organization of web
            documents, improved accessibility features, and improved ease and
            efficiency for search engines to crawl and rank websites (SEO).

          <p>
            HTML5 has also added support for more media formats on the web with
            tags like <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>,
            and has also added support for various form input tags and
            attributes for different types of user input and client-side
            validation.

        It has been over 30 years since HTML was first created, but it still
        lives up to its original purpose.
